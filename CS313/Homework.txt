boolean match(int A[], int M,int size){
	int i = 0,j = size-1,sum;
	while(i<j){
		sum=A[i]+A[j];
		if (sum==M) return true;
		else if (sum<M) i++;
		else j--;
	}
	return false;
}

Consider the worst case time and count comparisons:
Worst case is that sum is not in the list.
Each iteration of the loop has two comparisons:
Is i<j?
Is sum==M?
We have 2(n-1) comparisons total for executing the while loop.
And 1 more comparision to exit the while loop when i==j.
Total runtime is 2(n-1)+1 = 2n - 1 is O(n).
