[zhyu1201@venus bin]$

3.List its contents
[zhyu1201@venus bin]$ ls 

4.List 6 commands that you recognize

id                                   syndaemon

5.Get a listing of the device directory. Do you recognize any device?
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ cd /dev
[zhyu1201@venus dev]$ ls 
autofs           lp1                 tty1   tty39  ttyS1
block            lp2                 tty10  tty4   ttyS2

There is no device conncected to my pc.

6.Go to /etc directory
[zhyu1201@venus dev]$ cd /etc
[zhyu1201@venus etc]$ 

7.Do a long listing; Mention a few files that you have already heard about.
[zhyu1201@venus etc]$ ls -l
total 2484
-rw-r--r--.  1 root   root         16 Jan  2  2015 adjtime
-rw-r--r--.  1 root   root        841 Jun  7  2013 csh.login
-rw-r--r--.  1 root   root         21 Jan  2  2015 hostname
-rw-r--r--.  1 root   root        199 Jan  5  2015 hosts
-rw-r--r--.  1 root   root     191658 Sep 28 00:42 passwd

8.What is the most used permission? What does it mean?
r - read

9.Using the cat command, take a look at the profile and login.defs files
[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ cat profile
# /etc/profile
# System wide environment and startup programs, for login setup
# Functions and aliases go in /etc/bashrc
# It's NOT a good idea to change this file unless you know what you
# are doing. It's much better to create a custom.sh shell script in
# /etc/profile.d/ to make custom changes to your environment, as this
# will prevent the need for merging in future updates.

[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ cat login.defs
#
# Please note that the parameters in this configuration file control the
# behavior of the tools from the shadow-utils component. None of these
# tools uses the PAM mechanism, and the utilities that use PAM (such as the
# passwd command) should therefore be configured elsewhere. Refer to
# /etc/pam.d/system-auth for more information.

10.Using cat, check the passwd file or similar; look for yourself in the file.
[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ cat passwd
[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ grep zhyu1201 /etc/passwd
zhyu1201:x:5791:800:Yuqian Zhang:/home/fa15/316/zhyu1201:/bin/tcsh

11.Type:echo $HOME
[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ echo $HOME
/home/fa15/316/zhyu1201

12. Type:pwd
[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ pwd
/etc

Part C:
1. Check your default shell using: echo $SHELL
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash

2. Use the chsh command and find a list of available shells.
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ chsh -l
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/sbin/nologin
/usr/bin/sh
/usr/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/nologin
/bin/tcsh
/bin/csh
/bin/ksh
/bin/rksh

3. Change the current shell to a tcsh 
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ chsh
Changing shell for zhyu1201.
New shell [/bin/bash]:  /bin/tcsh
Password: 
Shell changed.

4. Check your new shell. The change will not be listed until the next login.
Before new login:
[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
Then logout:
[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ logout
After new login:
[zhyu1201@venus /etc]$ echo $SHELL
/bin/tcsh

5. Type ps (process status – gives a lists of running processes). What do you observe?
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
13061 pts/29   00:00:00 tcsh
13224 pts/29   00:00:00 ps

6. At the shell prompt, type set | more and then press <enter>. What is displayed on your
screen?
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ set|more
_       ps

If I press <Enter>, It will keep show setting detials until the end.

7. Identify and list the settings for the variables shown above.
user 
euid
home
p
group
cwd

8. Use the man command and read about the setenv command.
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ man setenv
SETENV(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 SETENV(3)

NAME
       setenv - change or add an environment variable

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

Part D:
1. Learn about the ps command using man.
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ man ps
PS(1)                            User Commands                           PS(1)
NAME
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.
SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]


2. Give a list of possible states together with their significance. Identify your login shell.
  D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
  R    running or runnable (on run queue)
  S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
  T    stopped by job control signal
  t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
  W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
  X    dead (should never be seen)
  Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ ps h p $$
13061 pts/29   Ss     0:00 -tcsh

3. Type ps –l and explain the significance of:F, S, UID, PID, PPID, C, PRI, NI, ADDR, SZ, WCHAN, TTY, TIME, CMD fields.
F:(-l and l flags) Some of the more important F field flags (hexadecimal and additive) 
S:(-l and l flags) The state of the process or kernel thread
UID:(-f, -l, and l flags) The user ID of the process owner. The login name is printed under the -f flag.
PID:(all flags) The process ID of the process.
PPID:(-f, l, and -l flags) The process ID of the parent process.
C: (-f, l, and -l flags) CPU utilization of process or thread, incremented each time the system clock ticks and the process or thread is found to be running.
PRI:(-l and l flags) The priority of the process or kernel thread ; higher numbers mean lower priority.
NI:(-l and l flags) The nice value; used in calculating priority for the sched other policy.
ADDER:(-l and l flags) Contains the segment number of the process stack, if normal; if a kernel process, the address of the preprocess data area.
SZ:(-l and l flags) The size in 1KB units of the core image of the process.
WCHAN:(l flag) The event on which process is waiting (an address in the system). A symbol is chosen that classifies the address, unless numerical output is requested.
TTY:(all flags) The controlling workstation for the process.
TIME:(all flags) The total execution time for the process.
CMD:(-f, -l, and l flags) Contains the command name. The full command name and its parameters are displayed with the -f flag.

4. Use the top command to monitor the CPU activity in real time. It displays the status of the
first 15 of the most CPU-intensive task on the system as well as the CPU activity. To stop
the execution of top enter <ctrl-C>.
[zhyu1201@venus ~]$ top
